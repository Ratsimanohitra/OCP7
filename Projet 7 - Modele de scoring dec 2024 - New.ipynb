    "Business Score : -152703.2 (le score métier est le plus bas ici, ce qui signifie que LightGBM minimise mieux les coûts business associés aux erreurs).\n",
    "Accuracy : 71.47% (le meilleur score de précision parmi les modèles testés).\n",
    "F1 Score : 0.283 (légèrement meilleur que les autres modèles, mais faible, probablement à cause d’un déséquilibre marqué des classes).\n",

    "Conclusion :\n",
    "LightGBM reste le meilleur modèle dans les deux cas (avec et sans undersampling). Cependant, sans undersampling, il atteint un meilleur Business Score, Accuracy, et F1 Score, ce qui suggère qu’il peut gérer les classes déséquilibrées de manière native.\n",
